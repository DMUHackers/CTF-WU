# Length Lingo
Can you crack the code? We intercepted this flag but can't seem to figure out how it was encrypted.

## Solution
1. We figured that the number of characters between the commas would be significant, so we created some python to output these numbers
2. Seeing that a lot of the numbers where in the ascii range we then altered our python to output the ascii representations
3. This gave us the flag
