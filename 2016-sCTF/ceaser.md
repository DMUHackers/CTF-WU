`Nvctfdv kf jTKW! Nv yfgv pfl veafp kyv gifscvdj nv yrmv nizkkve wfi kyv wzijk hlrikvi fw 2016. Yviv zj pfli wzijk fw (yfgvwlccp) drep wcrxj! jtkw{ny3e_1e_tkw_u0_r5_tkw3i5_u0}`

   Welcome to sCTF! We hope you enjoy the problems we have written for the first quarter of 2016. Here is your first of (hopefully) many flags! sctf{wh3n_1n_ctf_d0_a5_ctf3r5_d0}
   ```
3. And there is our answer `sctf{wh3n_1n_ctf_d0_a5_ctf3r5_d0}`
