Welcome to Vertinet.

This problem follows the same specifications as the previous Verticode problem, except that you have to solve many of them by developing a client to communicate with the server available at problems1.2016q1.sctf.io:50000. Good luck.

## Solution
1. We created python code to download the pngs and run the vert code against each image
2. this eventually gave us the key `sctf{y0ub34tth3v3rt1c0d3}`
